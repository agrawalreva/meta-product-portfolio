# reva's meta portfolio

**real products for real people**

## what is this

my attempt at being a big boy about product management. here's what i actually know and what i'm actually building.

## what you'll find here

- **product concepts** - detailed roadmaps for meta's next big bets
- **my (very much a work-in-progress) process**
- **breakfast ideas**

## tech stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript** - because i like my code to actually work
- **Tailwind CSS** - utility-first styling that doesn't make me want to cry
- **Shadcn/ui** - pre-built components that look good without the headache
- **Vite** - fast builds because waiting is for suckers

## local development

```bash
# clone my masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/agrawalreva/meta-product-portfolio.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# start the dev server
npm run dev
```

## deployment

this awesome portfolio lives on **Vercel** because it's free and it works. every push to main auto-deploys.
