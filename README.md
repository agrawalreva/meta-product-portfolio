# reva's meta portfolio

**real products for real people**

## what is this

my attempt at being a big boy about product management. here's what i actually know and what i'm actually building.

## what you'll find here

- **product concepts** - detailed roadmaps for meta's next big bets
- **my (very much a work-in-progress) process**
- **breakfast ideas**

## tech stack

- **React 18** + **TypeScript** because i like my code to actually work
- **Tailwind CSS** styling that doesn't make me want to cry
- **Shadcn/ui** for components
- **Vite** because waiting is for suckers
